# About #

Web application development (Web app development) is the creation of application programs that reside on remote servers and are delivered to the user’s device over the Internet. It can be any application that is run within an internet browser or is, on the other hand, designed in a programing language which is browser-supported such as JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

The popularity of web app development has increased because of the simplicity of running application and runibility of the application without instaling it on client's PC. In addition to this, today's web application clients are able to use webmail, buy or sell online without distributing the applications over their own personal machines.

Web application world has become one of the most significant methods of comuncation and information sharing in the modern world.

When the World Wide Web first took off in the mid-1990s, the mechanism for displaying web pages was based on a straightforward request-response model. Browser software on a desktop computer sent a request for a page to a server, and the server responded with a copy of that page. Creating web applications that provide the same level of interactivity as desktop applications has been the Holy Grail of web development from beginning. But cross-browser and version incompatibilities in script languages, primitive styling and graphics capabilities, as well as the limits of the fundamental page request-response model were early barriers to achieving this goal.<br>
<br>
Before long, plug-in technologies such as Java applets and Active X controls made it possible to update interface elements within a page on-the-fly. However, due to performance and security issues, applets and ActiveX controls fell out of favor. Early versions of web technologies such as JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) allowed designers and developers to provide simple interactivity without plug-ins; but in practice such technologies were plagued by browser and version incompatibilities. Most application logic, whether interacting with databases or responding to user requests, was still executed by the server. As a result, most web interfaces during the first decade of web development felt primitive compared to traditional desktop applications. And as services available over the web became more complex, most application development was focused on server-side programming.<br>
<br>
In the request-response model, a user clicks a hyperlink or a form’s Submit button, and the browser sends a request to the server. The server passes data to a Java program, Python script, CGI process, or something similar. When the server has finished processing the request, it sends back a completely new page. This model changed in the mid-2000s with the rise of AJAX, or Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. In an AJAX-enabled browser application, when the user clicks an interface element such as a button, the browser sends data to a JavaScript program running on the client, rather than directly to the server. This code uses the JavaScript XMLHTTPRequest object to request new data, which is returned to theJavaScript program. The JavaScript program—not a server-generated web page—decides what the user sees, updating the page contents granularly and on the fly to achieve desktop-quality responsiveness.<br>
<br>
Combined with more mature HTML and CSS technologies, this hybrid approach made it possible to build highly responsive applications powered by nothing more than a standards-compliant browser. Today, AJAX toolkits and JavaScript application frameworks are widely used for developing high-end consumer websites.<br>
<br>
When we look over chronologically;<br>
<ul><li>In 1995 Netscape introduced a client-side scripting language called JavaScript allowing programmers to add some dynamic elements to the user interface that ran on the client side.</li></ul>

<ul><li>In 1996, Macromedia introduced Flash, a vector animation player that could be added to browsers as a plug-in to embed animations on the web pages. It allowed the use of a scripting language to program interactions on the client side with no need to communicate with the server.</li></ul>

<ul><li>In 1999, the "web application" concept was introduced in the Java language in the Servlet Specification version 2.2. At that time both JavaScript and XML had already been developed, but Ajax had still not yet been coined and the XMLHttpRequest object had only been recently introduced on Internet Explorer 5 as an ActiveX object.</li></ul>

<ul><li>In 2005, the term Ajax was coined, and applications like Gmail started to make their client sides more and more interactive. A web page script is able to contact the server for storing/retrieving data without downloading an entire web page.</li></ul>

<ul><li>In 2011, HTML5 was finalized, which provides graphic and multimedia capabilities without the need of client side plugins. HTML5 also enriched the semantic content of documents. The APIs and document object model (DOM) are no longer afterthoughts, but are fundamental parts of the HTML5 specification. WebGL API paved the way for advanced 3D graphics based on HTML5 canvas and JavaScript language. These have significant importance in creating truly platform and browser independent rich web applications.</li></ul>

An example of web application is depicted in the picture below.<br>

A software <b>framework</b> is a set of source code or libraries which provide functionality common to a whole class of applications.<br>
There are apparantly many programing languages that supports and facilatates  the web app development such as HTML, JavaScript and so on.<br>
<br>
The most frequently used and popular development pattern of web application framaworks is MVC (Model-View-Controller). The main thing that lieas behand this framework is the platform itself which evaluates the URL and redirect the responsibility to the suitible and appropriate application controller.<br>
Every web app takes its own HTTP request and build appropriate response. This can be handled and processed in a number of manners, somehow dependent on the server platform.<br>
<br>
Another consideration of the design of a framework is its flow of execution. Often, all requests to a web application are passed through a single set of code provided by a framework, such as index.php at the root of a PHP application. This code is responsible for initializing user sessions, database connectivity, and anything else required on every page load. Control is then passed along to the application-specific code responsible for generating the particular content requested. Python's web.py, for example, takes a list of URLs and the class names which are provided by the application to handle them.<br>
<br>
In order to write a web application we use web frameworks that are described above. Those frameworks such as Django, Ruby or Symfony are often open source softvers which simplifies the process of web application development. When a web application is developed by a team, those frameworks helps the team to concentrate and focus on the parts of the project (application) which are unique to their objective without solving the issues that are related to the client i.e. user management.<br>
<br>
The usage of web application frameworks almost always decrease the roboust instances of errors in a program by making the code simpler and by allowing the group to concentrate on the framework while another focuses on a specified use case. Additionally, the online applications can also be harmed by hackers in the way that they make intentional erreor in the application. The frameworks mentioned here can also be helpfull in such a situation and resolve the problem.<br>
<br>
Although web applicatins are very simple and populare, there are certain risks connected with web applications. Just as with a traditional desktop application, web applications have varying levels of risk. A personal home page is much less risky than, for example, a stock trading web site. For some projects security, software bugs, etc. are major issues. If time to market, or technical complexity is a concern, documentation, test planning, change control, requirements analysis, architectural description and formal design and construction practices can mitigate risk<br>
