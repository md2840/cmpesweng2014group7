# Introduction #

Hello everyone! My name is Dilara and I'm studying my 9th semester in Bogazici University. The reason my education took longer than normal is that I went to Seoul- South Korea, Hanyang University, for 1 semester as an exchange.

Right now I am hesitating whether to continue my academic life or take a leap to the working environment.


# Interests #

As for the academic interests, I really like the aspect of technology that is beneficial to not just humans but the universe. Right now my interest is in the medical field. I want to use the engineering and computer skills I have in the medical field maybe compensate for the fact that I haven't chosen medicine despite my mom's wishes - not regretting - It can change in the future though.

For hobbies and all, I like Japanese language. I've been studying Japanese for 4 years now and I have JLPT for N3 level studying toward getting N2. I like watching Japanese TV shows and being able to laugh at Japanese humor terrifies me.
