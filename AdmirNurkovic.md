# About Me #

Graduated from "30. September" high school in Montenegro. Right now I am a student at Computer Engineering Department Bogazic University. Truely interested in politics and social sciences even though those are not bringing any good to the societies all over the world. I am also interested in programing especially in application development, therefore I am familiar with programing langages such as Java, C++ and C.
I also adore being integrated in the NGO sector; thus, I am a member of a bunch of NG organizations back there in Montenegro. My moto is: **Yesterday is history, tomorow is mystery  but today is a gift. That's why it is called present.**

# Work Experience #

I worked for about 4 months at "Sentio Sports Analytics" on the web development project. The project that we were developing was very complex and I think this job experience that I had gained will be very helpfull in the future. This project was developed in Django which is a Python based web developing tool which togather with strong CSS deployment makes a web site looking very amazing.
