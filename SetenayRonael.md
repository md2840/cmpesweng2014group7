# Introduction #

> I am CMPE student on fourth year. This is my second time that I take Cmpe 352. I am interested in academic life. Especially I want to study on Cognitive Science.

# Info About Education #

> In my second year on the department, I was the student asistant of CMPE 160 course for a semester. Then next Summer, I started on a Java Applet project for Tuna Tuğcu's Molecular Communications Approach to NanoNetworking research. Unfortunately, it was interrupted cause of beginning of the new semester.

> In 2012 Summer, I was working at Turkcell Teknoloji for my summer training. I wrote codes with VBScript for automation of tests. It was not a big deal.

> In 2013 Summer, I was working at Inomera Research. I worked on develeoping and testing part of Netmera. I wrote PhoneGap Plugin for Netmera.


# Info About Other Kinds of Works #

> In 2012,I spent few time at Etiler Dinlenme Tesisleri to make the library organized and to meet people. Since I've got a change to meet Leman Şenalp, the most important librarian of Turkey they said.

> In holiday on February 2013, for three days I was at Yakacık Çocuk Yuvası with my friends. We had played with kids to make them more curious about the world!

> In 2013 Spring I thought physics, chemistry and biology for 7th class student at ÇYDD. I hope it will be amazing for me, and maybe for children.

# My Hobbies #

> I'm in Büdak also. I went to Niğde for three times. I'm a member of Boğaziçi University Climbing Team and also YK of Büdak. I'm continuing to go to climbing wall now. It makes me more relax and energic. Actually in 22/02/2013 there is an bouldering competition in Sakarya.

> Moreover, I spend my time with memorizing lyrics, singing(actually this one takes **_ALL_** of my time), playing instruments(harmonica, guitar, org), learning Spanish and searching about politics and psychology.

> All this information is here, because I've just realized that when I'm able to see what I've done in past, I am more ardent to keep going!
