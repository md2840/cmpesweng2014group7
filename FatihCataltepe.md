# About Me #
Graduated from Maltepe Military School and left Land Forces Academy after two years of education in 2010. It is my third year in Bogazici University as a computer engineering student now.

I know about Java, C, C++ thanks to the courses I took so far. Additionally I'm experienced about Android OS since having internship at "Sentio Sports Analytics" as a mobile developer. I am still working for Sentio as a developer.

# Hobbies #
I like doing almost all kinds of sports in leisure time; play football, tennis; spent most of my time with running and swimming. I am also very interested in listening music. I mean rock, real rock.
