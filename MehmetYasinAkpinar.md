# Introduction #

I am a METU - Electrical & Electronics Engineering graduate doing M.Sc in Bogaici University currently. Therefore, I am taking this course as remedial.

I know C and C++ fairly well and getting used to python lately.

I am interested in watching anime series, origami, ping-pong and swimming.
