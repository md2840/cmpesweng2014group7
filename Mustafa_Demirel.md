# About me #

I am currently a CS student at Bogazici University. I have been studying this major for 4 years now, I am a bit late taking this course due to lazy days back then, fortunately, I got my lesson and I am a hardworking student right now.

I know Java, C and C++ thanks to the Cmpe courses I took. I did an internship in the gsm operator Avea two years ago and learnt quite a bit about how a big company operates with all kinds of different departments.

I like to watch movies, play football and read politics.

I hope to have a successful semester with my colleagues.
