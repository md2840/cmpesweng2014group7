# About me #

_I'm junior student in Computer Engineering Department at Bogazici University. I graduated from Samsun Science High School in 2010._

First three years of my university life has passed with Compec (Bogazici University IT Club). Firstly, I was a little computer enthusiast girl. Then I wantted to make more contribution to the club, I decided to become a board member. After one year board member experience, I became vice president. Now, I just try to attend events of Compec. Additionally, I suggest Computer Engineering students at Bogazici University especially who are in their first or second years to become a member of Compec.

After three years with IT Club, I rest last semester. Now, I'm ready to improve myself in different ways. I want to learn French and to attend painting class of Bogazici University Fine Arts Club.

Besides clubs, I traveled some cities in Europe with my friends in 2012. We were backpacking travelers. Before Europe adventure, I have been in Boston, USA for a month in 2009. I think travelling opens a new window in one's life.

One of my favorite things is Doctor Who TV series. I like sci-fi, fantasy movies, animations, and cartoons. My favorite super hero is Spiderman.
